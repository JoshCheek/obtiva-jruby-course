1. Install Java 1.6
  1.1 Mac
    You should have Java already installed
    you can skip this step, but check
    your java version with "java -version"
    It should be 1.6 or later

  1.2 Linux / Windows
    You can download the latest Java SDK here: 
    http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
    Follow the provided instructions.  You 
    Can verify your install by typing "java -version" 
    from a terminal 

2. Install JRuby 1.6
  2.1 Mac / Linux
    I HIGHLY recommend you use rvm to manage your 
    installed ruby interpreters, including JRuby
    
    2.1.1 Installing RVM (http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/)
      Try the quick install first (from a shell): 
        $ bash < <( curl http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/releases/rvm-install-head )

      *** Make sure you follow the on-screen instructions!!!!

      If that doesn't work or you'd like to install it for your user only, 
      try one of the install instructions here: 

      http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/

    2.1.2 Installing JRuby with rvm
      Pretty simple: 
        $ rvm install jruby-1.6.0
      Now use it: 
        $ rvm use jruby-1.6.0
      And to go back to the default ruby: 
        $ rvm system
    2.1.3 Creating and using a gemset
        Gemsets are different sets of gems that you 
        can use by a name you provide.  let's create
        a gemset for JRuby: 
          $ rvm use jruby-1.6.0
          $ rvm gemset create reddirt

        To chose the gemset and ruby at the same time: 
          $ rvm use jruby-1.6.0@reddirt

  2.2 Windows / no RVM
    Follow the JRuby installation instructions here: 
      http://www.jruby.org/getting-started
    
    Make sure the following two commands work for you: 
      $ jruby --help
      $ jirb

3. Installing Gems
  3.1 rvm users
    $ rvm gemset import course.gems

  3.2 Windows / non rvm users
    Open the gemfile and install each gem + version by hand. 
    Or write a script for it!

4. Testing things out
  3.1 Jruby
    From the course directory run: 
      $ ruby first_half/layouts.rb
  3.2 Rails
    From the course direcory: 
      $ cd second_half/deploying_rails/hello_world
      $ rails server

    Go to localhost:3000 in your browser, you should see "hello world"
